**OnTime — Islamic Prayer Times**

*Last updated: February 6, 2026*

## Overview

OnTime is designed with privacy in mind. The app performs all prayer time calculations locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or sell any personal data.

## Data That Stays on Your Device

The following data is stored **only on your device** and is never transmitted to any server:

- Prayer calculation settings and preferences
- Prayer tracking history
- Jumuah and travel mode settings
- Theme and display preferences
- Your home base location (for travel mode)

All data is stored locally using your device's storage and is not accessible to us or any third party.

## Location Data

OnTime requests access to your device's GPS location to calculate accurate prayer times and Qibla direction for your position. This location data is:

- **Processed locally** on your device for prayer time calculations
- **Sent to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service** solely to convert your coordinates into a human-readable location name (e.g., "Toronto, Canada"). This is the only external network request the app makes. You can review Nominatim's usage policy at https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/
- **Never stored on any external server** by us
- **Never shared with advertisers or third parties** by us

You can also set your location manually without using GPS.

## Third-Party Services

The app uses the following third-party service:

- **OpenStreetMap / Nominatim** — For reverse geocoding (coordinates to city name) and embedded map display. OpenStreetMap is an open-source project governed by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Their privacy policy is available at https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy

## Children's Privacy
